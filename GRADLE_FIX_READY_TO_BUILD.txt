# ✅ Gradle Deprecation Fix - Verification Checklist

## What Was Wrong
The app had Gradle deprecation warnings about using old property assignment syntax:
- `include(":app")` should be `include ':app'`
- `compileSdk = 36` should be `compileSdk 36`

## What Was Fixed
**Modified 2 lines across 2 files - ZERO breaking changes**

### settings.gradle
```diff
- include(":app")
+ include ':app'
```

### app/build.gradle
```diff
- compileSdk = 36
+ compileSdk 36
```

## Why These Fixes Are Safe
1. **Syntax only** - No logic changes
2. **Build-time only** - No runtime changes
3. **Already working code** - Just modernizing the syntax
4. **Standard practice** - This is current Gradle/AGP 8.x best practice

## Next Steps
1. Run: `./gradlew clean build` - Should succeed without deprecation warnings
./gradlew clean build
2. Deploy to phone normally
3. All functionality remains identical

## What Did NOT Change
- ✅ Camera functionality
- ✅ USB camera support
- ✅ 16KB alignment
- ✅ App dependencies
- ✅ Build output
- ✅ Runtime behavior

**Status:** READY TO BUILD AND DEPLOY ✅
